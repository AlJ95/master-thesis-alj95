<h1>interface <code>org.apache.hadoop.fs.MultipartUploader</code></h1>
<ul>



</ul></li>




</ul></li></ul>

<p>The <code>MultipartUploader</code> can upload a file using multiple parts to Hadoop-supported filesystems. The benefits of a multipart upload is that the file can be uploaded from multiple clients or processes in parallel and the results will not be visible to other clients until the <code>complete</code> function is called.</p>
<p>When implemented by an object store, uploaded data may incur storage charges, even before it is visible in the filesystems. Users of this API must be diligent and always perform best-effort attempts to complete or abort the upload. The <code>abortUploadsUnderPath(path)</code> operation can help here.</p><section>
<h2><a name="Invariants"></a>Invariants</h2>
<p>All the requirements of a valid <code>MultipartUploader</code> are considered implicit econditions and postconditions:</p>
<p>The operations of a single multipart upload may take place across different instance of a multipart uploader, across different processes and hosts. It is therefore a requirement that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>

<p>All state needed to upload a part, complete an upload or abort an upload must be contained within or retrievable from an upload handle.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>That handle MUST be serializable; it MUST be deserializable to different processes executing the exact same version of Hadoop.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>different hosts/processes MAY upload different parts, sequentially or simultaneously. The order in which they are uploaded to the filesystem MUST NOT constrain the order in which the data is stored in the final file.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>An upload MAY be completed on a different instance than any which uploaded parts.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The output of an upload MUST NOT be visible at the final destination until the upload may complete.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>It is not an error if a single multipart uploader instance initiates or completes multiple uploads files to the same destination sequentially, irrespective of whether or not the store supports concurrent uploads.</p>
</li>
</ol></section><section>
<h2><a name="Concurrency"></a>Concurrency</h2>
<p>Multiple processes may upload parts of a multipart upload simultaneously.</p>
<p>If a call is made to <code>startUpload(path)</code> to a destination where an active upload is in progress, implementations MUST perform one of the two operations.</p>
<ul>

<li>Reject the call as a duplicate.</li>
<li>Permit both to proceed, with the final output of the file being that of <i>exactly one of the two uploads</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which upload succeeds is undefined. Users must not expect consistent behavior across filesystems, across filesystem instances *or even across different requests.</p>
<p>If a multipart upload is completed or aborted while a part upload is in progress, the in-progress upload, if it has not completed, must not be included in the final file, in whole or in part. Implementations SHOULD raise an error in the <code>putPart()</code> operation.</p>
<h1>Serialization Compatibility</h1>
<p>Users MUST NOT expect that serialized PathHandle versions are compatible across * different multipart uploader implementations. * different versions of the same implementation.</p>
<p>That is: all clients MUST use the exact same version of Hadoop.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Model"></a>Model</h2>
<p>A FileSystem/FileContext which supports Multipart Uploads extends the existing model <code>(Directories, Files, Symlinks)</code> to one of <code>(Directories, Files, Symlinks, Uploads)</code> <code>Uploads</code> of type <code>Map[UploadHandle -&gt; Map[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Uploads</code> element of the state tuple is a map of all active uploads.</p>

<div class="source">
<div class="source">
<pre>Uploads: Map[UploadHandle -&gt; Map[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]`
</pre></div></div>

<p>An UploadHandle is a non-empty list of bytes.</p>

<div class="source">
<div class="source">
<pre>UploadHandle: List[byte]
len(UploadHandle) &gt; 0
</pre></div></div>

<p>Clients <i>MUST</i> treat this as opaque. What is core to this features design is that the handle is valid from across clients: the handle may be serialized on host <code>hostA</code>, deserialized on <code>hostB</code> and still used to extend or complete the upload.</p>

<div class="source">
<div class="source">
<pre>UploadPart = (Path: path, parts: Map[PartHandle -&gt; byte[]])
</pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, the <code>PartHandle</code> type is also a non-empty list of opaque bytes, again, marshallable between hosts.</p>

<div class="source">
<div class="source">
<pre>PartHandle: List[byte]
</pre></div></div>

<p>It is implicit that each <code>UploadHandle</code> in <code>FS.Uploads</code> is unique. Similarly, each <code>PartHandle</code> in the map of <code>[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]</code> must also be unique.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>There is no requirement that Part Handles are unique across uploads.</li>
<li>There is no requirement that Upload Handles are unique over time. However, if Part Handles are rapidly recycled, there is a risk that the nominally idempotent operation <code>abort(FS, uploadHandle)</code> could unintentionally cancel a successor operation which used the same Upload Handle.</li>
</ol></section><section>
<h2><a name="Asynchronous_API"></a>Asynchronous API</h2>
<p>All operations return <code>CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;</code> types which must be subsequently evaluated to get their return values.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The execution of the operation MAY be a blocking operation in on the call thread.</li>
<li>If not, it SHALL be executed in a separate thread and MUST complete by the time the future evaluation returns.</li>
<li>Some/All preconditions MAY be evaluated at the time of initial invocation,</li>
<li>All those which are not evaluated at that time, MUST Be evaluated during the execution of the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that when an implementation interacts with a fast file system/store all preconditions including the existence of files MAY be evaluated early, whereas and implementation interacting with a remote object store whose probes are slow MAY verify preconditions in the asynchronous phase -especially those which interact with the remote store.</p>
<p>Java CompletableFutures do not work well with checked exceptions. The Hadoop codease is still evolving the details of the exception handling here, as more use is made of the asynchronous APIs. Assume that any precondition failure which declares that an <code>IOException</code> MUST be raised may have that operation wrapped in a <code>RuntimeException</code> of some form if evaluated in the future; this also holds for any other <code>IOException</code> raised during the operations.</p><section>
<h3><a name="close.28.29"></a><code>close()</code></h3>
<p>Applications MUST call <code>close()</code> after using an uploader; this is so it may release other objects, update statistics, etc.</p></section></section><section>
