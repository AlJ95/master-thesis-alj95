<h1>class <tt>org.apache.hadoop.fs.MultipartUploader</tt></h1>
<ul>






</ul></li></ul>

<p>The abstract <tt>MultipartUploader</tt> class is the original class to upload a file using multiple parts to Hadoop-supported filesystems. The benefits of a multipart upload is that the file can be uploaded from multiple clients or processes in parallel and the results will not be visible to other clients until the <tt>complete</tt> function is called.</p>
<p>When implemented by an object store, uploaded data may incur storage charges, even before it is visible in the filesystems. Users of this API must be diligent and always perform best-effort attempts to complete or abort the upload.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Invariants"></a>Invariants</h2>
<p>All the requirements of a valid MultipartUploader are considered implicit econditions and postconditions: all operations on a valid MultipartUploader MUST result in a new MultipartUploader that is also valid.</p>
<p>The operations of a single multipart upload may take place across different instance of a multipart uploader, across different processes and hosts. It is therefore a requirement that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>

<p>All state needed to upload a part, complete an upload or abort an upload must be contained within or retrievable from an upload handle.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If an upload handle is marshalled to another process, then, if the receiving process has the correct permissions, it may participate in the upload, by uploading one or more parts, by completing an upload, and/or by aborting the upload.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Concurrency"></a>Concurrency</h2>
<p>Multiple processes may upload parts of a multipart upload simultaneously.</p>
<p>If a call is made to <tt>initialize(path)</tt> to a destination where an active upload is in progress, implementations MUST perform one of the two operations.</p>
<ul>

<li>Reject the call as a duplicate.</li>
<li>Permit both to proceed, with the final output of the file being that of <i>exactly one of the two uploads</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which upload succeeds is undefined. Users must not expect consistent behavior across filesystems, across filesystem instances *or even across different requests.</p>
<p>If a multipart upload is completed or aborted while a part upload is in progress, the in-progress upload, if it has not completed, must not be included in the final file, in whole or in part. Implementations SHOULD raise an error in the <tt>putPart()</tt> operation.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Model"></a>Model</h2>
<p>A File System which supports Multipart Uploads extends the existing model <tt>(Directories, Files, Symlinks)</tt> to one of <tt>(Directories, Files, Symlinks, Uploads)</tt> <tt>Uploads</tt> of type <tt>Map[UploadHandle -&gt; Map[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt>Uploads</tt> element of the state tuple is a map of all active uploads.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">Uploads: Map[UploadHandle -&gt; Map[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]`
</pre></div></div>

<p>An UploadHandle is a non-empty list of bytes.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">UploadHandle: List[byte]
len(UploadHandle) &gt; 0
</pre></div></div>

<p>Clients <i>MUST</i> treat this as opaque. What is core to this features design is that the handle is valid from across clients: the handle may be serialized on host <tt>hostA</tt>, deserialized on <tt>hostB</tt> and still used to extend or complete the upload.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">UploadPart = (Path: path, parts: Map[PartHandle -&gt; byte[]])
</pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, the <tt>PartHandle</tt> type is also a non-empty list of opaque bytes, again, marshallable between hosts.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">PartHandle: List[byte]
</pre></div></div>

<p>It is implicit that each <tt>UploadHandle</tt> in <tt>FS.Uploads</tt> is unique. Similarly, each <tt>PartHandle</tt> in the map of <tt>[PartHandle -&gt; UploadPart]</tt> must also be unique.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>There is no requirement that Part Handles are unique across uploads.</li>
<li>There is no requirement that Upload Handles are unique over time. However, if Part Handles are rapidly recycled, there is a risk that the nominally idempotent operation <tt>abort(FS, uploadHandle)</tt> could unintentionally cancel a successor operation which used the same Upload Handle.</li>
</ol></div>

<h2><a name="State_Changing_Operations"></a>State Changing Operations</h2>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="UploadHandle_initialize.28Path_path.29"></a><tt>UploadHandle initialize(Path path)</tt></h3>
<p>Initialized a Multipart Upload, returning an upload handle for use in subsequent operations.</p>

<div>
<div>

if exists(FS, path) and not isFile(FS, path) raise PathIsDirectoryException, IOException

</pre></div></div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="Postconditions"></a>Postconditions</h4>
<p>The outcome of this operation is that the filesystem state is updated with a new active upload, with a new handle, this handle being returned to the caller.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">handle' = UploadHandle where not handle' in keys(FS.Uploads)

partHandle' = byte[] where not partHandle' in keys(FS.uploads(uploadHandle).parts)
FS' = FS where FS'.uploads(uploadHandle).parts(partHandle') == data'
result = partHandle'
</pre></div></div>

<p>The data is stored in the filesystem, pending completion.</p></div></div>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="PathHandle_complete.28Path_path.2C_Map.3CInteger.2C_PartHandle.3E_parts.2C_UploadHandle_multipartUploadId.29"></a><tt>PathHandle complete(Path path, Map&lt;Integer, PartHandle&gt; parts, UploadHandle multipartUploadId)</tt></h3>
<p>Complete the multipart upload.</p>
<p>A Filesystem may enforce a minimum size of each part, excluding the last part uploaded.</p>
<p>If a part is out of this range, an <tt>IOException</tt> MUST be raised.</p>
<div class="section">
<h4><a name="Preconditions"></a>Preconditions</h4>

<div>
<div>

parts.size() &gt; 0
</pre></div></div>

<p>If there are handles in the MPU which aren&#x2019;t included in the map, then the omitted parts will not be a part of the resulting file. It is up to the implementation of the MultipartUploader to make sure the leftover parts are cleaned up.</p>
<p>In the case of backing stores that support directories (local filesystem, HDFS, etc), if, at the point of completion, there is now a directory at the destination then a <tt>PathIsDirectoryException</tt> or other <tt>IOException</tt> must be thrown.</p></div>
<div class="section">

</pre></div></div>

<p>The PathHandle is returned by the complete operation so subsequent operations will be able to identify that the data has not changed in the meantime.</p>
<p>The order of parts in the uploaded by file is that of the natural order of parts: part 1 is ahead of part 2, etc.</p></div></div>
<div class="section">

<div>
<pre class="source">uploadHandle in keys(FS.Uploads) else raise FileNotFoundException

<div>
