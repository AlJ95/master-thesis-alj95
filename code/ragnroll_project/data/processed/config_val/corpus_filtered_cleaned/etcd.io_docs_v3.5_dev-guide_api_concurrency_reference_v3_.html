service Lock (server/etcdserver/api/v3lock/v3lockpb/v3lock.proto) The lock service exposes client-side locking facilities as a gRPC interface.
Method Request Type Response Type Description Lock LockRequest LockResponse Lock acquires a distributed shared lock on a given named lock. On success, it will return a unique key that exists so long as the lock is held by the caller. This key can be used in conjunction with transactions to safely ensure updates to etcd only occur while holding lock ownership. The lock is held until Unlock is called on the key or the lease associate with the owner expires. Unlock UnlockRequest UnlockResponse Unlock takes a key returned by Lock and releases the hold on lock. The next Lock caller waiting for the lock will then be woken up and given ownership of the lock. message LockRequest (server/etcdserver/api/v3lock/v3lockpb/v3lock.proto) Field Description Type name name is the identifier for the distributed shared lock to be acquired. bytes lease lease is the ID of the lease that will be attached to ownership of the lock. If the lease expires or is revoked and currently holds the lock, the lock is automatically released. Calls to Lock with the same lease will be treated as a single acquisition; locking twice with the same lease is a no-op. int64 message LockResponse (server/etcdserver/api/v3lock/v3lockpb/v3lock.proto) Field Description Type header etcdserverpb.ResponseHeader key key is a key that will exist on etcd for the duration that the Lock caller owns the lock. Users should not modify this key or the lock may exhibit undefined behavior. bytes message UnlockRequest (server/etcdserver/api/v3lock/v3lockpb/v3lock.proto) Field Description Type key key is the lock ownership key granted by Lock. bytes message UnlockResponse (server/etcdserver/api/v3lock/v3lockpb/v3lock.proto) Field Description Type header etcdserverpb.ResponseHeader service Election (server/etcdserver/api/v3election/v3electionpb/v3election.proto) The election service exposes client-side election facilities as a gRPC interface."><meta property="og:url" content="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-guide/api_concurrency_reference_v3/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="etcd"><meta property="og:title" content="API reference: concurrency"><meta property="og:description" content="This API reference is autogenerated from the named .proto files.
