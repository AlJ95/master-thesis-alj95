<p>Otherwise, before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature on the

<ul class="simple">
<li>Check that someone hasn’t already filed the bug or feature request by
<a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/search">searching</a> or running <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/query">custom queries</a> in the ticket tracker.</li>
<li>Don’t use the ticket system to ask support questions. Use the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-users-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-users</span></a> list or the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.libera.chat/#django">#django</a> IRC channel for that.</li>
<li>Don’t reopen issues that have been marked “wontfix” without finding consensus
to do so on <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a>.</li>
<li>Don’t use the ticket tracker for lengthy discussions, because they’re
likely to get lost. If a particular ticket is controversial, please move the
discussion to <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="s-reporting-bugs">

<p>Well-written bug reports are <em>incredibly</em> helpful. However, there’s a certain
amount of overhead involved in working with any bug tracking system so your
help in keeping our ticket tracker as useful as possible is appreciated. In
particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Do</strong> read the <a class="reference internal" href="../../../faq/"><span class="doc">FAQ</span></a> to see if your issue might
be a well-known question.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> ask on <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-users-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-users</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://web.libera.chat/#django">#django</a> <em>first</em> if you’re not sure if
what you’re seeing is a bug.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. You must
include a clear, concise description of the problem, and a set of
instructions for replicating it. Add as much debug information as you can:
code snippets, test cases, exception backtraces, screenshots, etc. A nice
small test case is the best way to report a bug, as it gives us a
helpful way to confirm the bug quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t</strong> post to <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> only to announce that you have filed a
bug report. All the tickets are mailed to another list, <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-updates-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-updates</span></a>,
which is tracked by developers and interested community members; we see them
as they are filed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand the lifecycle of your ticket once you have created it, refer to
<a class="reference internal" href="../triaging-tickets/"><span class="doc">Triaging tickets</span></a>.</p>

<span id="reporting-user-interface-bugs-and-features"></span><h2>Reporting user interface bugs and features<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-user-interface-bugs-and-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your bug or feature request touches on anything visual in nature, there
are a few additional guidelines to follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Include screenshots in your ticket which are the visual equivalent of a
minimal testcase. Show off the issue, not the crazy customizations
you’ve made to your browser.</li>
<li>If the issue is difficult to show off using a still image, consider
capturing a <em>brief</em> screencast. If your software permits it, capture only
the relevant area of the screen.</li>
<li>If you’re offering a patch which changes the look or behavior of Django’s
UI, you <strong>must</strong> attach before <em>and</em> after screenshots/screencasts.
Tickets lacking these are difficult for triagers to assess quickly.</li>
<li>Screenshots don’t absolve you of other good reporting practices. Make sure
to include URLs, code snippets, and step-by-step instructions on how to
reproduce the behavior visible in the screenshots.</li>
<li>Make sure to set the UI/UX flag on the ticket so interested parties can
find your ticket.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-requesting-features">
<span id="requesting-features"></span><h2>Requesting features<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We’re always trying to make Django better, and your feature requests are a key
part of that. Here are some tips on how to make a request most effectively:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure the feature actually requires changes in Django’s core. If your
idea can be developed as an independent application or module — for
instance, you want to support another database engine — we’ll probably
suggest that you develop it independently. Then, if your project gathers
sufficient community support, we may consider it for inclusion in Django.</li>
<li>First request the feature on the <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> list, not in the
ticket tracker. It’ll get read more closely if it’s on the mailing list.
This is even more important for large-scale feature requests. We like to
discuss any big changes to Django’s core on the mailing list before
actually working on them.</li>
<li>Describe clearly and concisely what the missing feature is and how you’d
like to see it implemented. Include example code (non-functional is OK)
if possible.</li>
<li>Explain <em>why</em> you’d like the feature. Explaining a minimal use case will help
others understand where it fits in, and if there are already other ways of
achieving the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s a consensus agreement on the feature, then it’s appropriate to
create a ticket. Include a link the discussion on <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> in the
ticket description.</p>
<p>As with most open-source projects, code talks. If you are willing to write the
code for the feature yourself or, even better, if you’ve already written it,
it’s much more likely to be accepted. Fork Django on GitHub, create a feature
branch, and show us your work!</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="s-how-we-make-decisions">
<span id="s-id2"></span><span id="how-we-make-decisions"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>How we make decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-make-decisions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whenever possible, we strive for a rough consensus. To that end, we’ll often
have informal votes on <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> about a feature. In these votes we
follow the voting style invented by Apache and used on Python itself, where
votes are given as +1, +0, -0, or -1. Roughly translated, these votes mean:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>+1: “I love the idea and I’m strongly committed to it.”</li>
<li>+0: “Sounds OK to me.”</li>
<li>-0: “I’m not thrilled, but I won’t stand in the way.”</li>
<li>-1: “I strongly disagree and would be very unhappy to see the idea turn
into reality.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these votes on <a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> are informal, they’ll be taken very
seriously. After a suitable voting period, if an obvious consensus arises we’ll
follow the votes.</p>
<p>However, consensus is not always possible. If consensus cannot be reached, or
if the discussion toward a consensus fizzles out without a concrete decision,
the decision may be deferred to the <a class="reference internal" href="../../organization/#technical-board"><span class="std std-ref">technical board</span></a>.</p>
<p>Internally, the technical board will use the same voting mechanism. A
proposition will be considered carried if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are at least three “+1” votes from members of the technical board.</li>
<li>There is no “-1” vote from any member of the technical board.</li>
</ul>
<p>Votes should be submitted within a week.</p>
<p>Since this process allows any technical board member to veto a proposal, a
“-1” vote should be accompanied by an explanation of what it would take to
convert that “-1” into at least a “+0”.</p>
<p>Votes on technical matters should be announced and held in public on the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../mailing-lists/#django-developers-mailing-list"><span class="std std-ref">django-developers</span></a> mailing list.</p>
