This happens when the server had migrated from v2 with no previous v3 data. This also prevents accidental v3 data loss (e.g. <code>db</code> file might have been moved). etcd requires that post v3 migration can only happen with v3 data. Do not upgrade to newer v3 versions until v3.0 server contains v3 data.</p><h4 id=monitoring>Monitoring</h4><p>Following metrics from v3.0.x have been deprecated in favor of <a href=https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus target=_blank rel=noopener>go-grpc-prometheus</a>:</p><ul><li><code>etcd_grpc_requests_total</code></li><li><code>etcd_grpc_requests_failed_total</code></li><li><code>etcd_grpc_active_streams</code></li><li><code>etcd_grpc_unary_requests_duration_seconds</code></li></ul><h4 id=upgrade-requirements>Upgrade requirements</h4><p>To upgrade an existing etcd deployment to 3.1, the running cluster must be 3.0 or greater. If it&rsquo;s before 3.0, please <a href=../upgrade_3_0>upgrade to 3.0</a> before upgrading to 3.1.</p><p>Also, to ensure a smooth rolling upgrade, the running cluster must be healthy. Check the health of the cluster by using the <code>etcdctl endpoint health</code> command before proceeding.</p><h4 id=preparation>Preparation</h4><p>Before upgrading etcd, always test the services relying on etcd in a staging environment before deploying the upgrade to the production environment.</p><p>Before beginning, <a href=../../op-guide/maintenance/#snapshot-backup>backup the etcd data</a>. Should something go wrong with the upgrade, it is possible to use this backup to <a href=#downgrade>downgrade</a> back to existing etcd version. Please note that the <code>snapshot</code> command only backs up the v3 data. For v2 data, see <a href=/docs/v2.3/admin_guide#backing-up-the-datastore>backing up v2 datastore</a>.</p><h4 id=mixed-versions>Mixed versions</h4><p>While upgrading, an etcd cluster supports mixed versions of etcd members, and operates with the protocol of the lowest common version. The cluster is only considered upgraded once all of its members are upgraded to version 3.1. Internally, etcd members negotiate with each other to determine the overall cluster version, which controls the reported version and the supported features.</p><h4 id=limitations>Limitations</h4><p>Note: If the cluster only has v3 data and no v2 data, it is not subject to this limitation.</p><p>If the cluster is serving a v2 data set larger than 50MB, each newly upgraded member may take up to two minutes to catch up with the existing cluster. Check the size of a recent snapshot to estimate the total data size. In other words, it is safest to wait for 2 minutes between upgrading each member.</p><p>For a much larger total data size, 100MB or more , this one-time process might take even more time. Administrators of very large etcd clusters of this magnitude can feel free to contact the <a href=https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev target=_blank rel=noopener>etcd team</a> before upgrading, and we&rsquo;ll be happy to provide advice on the procedure.</p><h4 id=downgrade>Downgrade</h4><p>If all members have been upgraded to v3.1, the cluster will be upgraded to v3.1, and downgrade from this completed state is <strong>not possible</strong>. If any single member is still v3.0, however, the cluster and its operations remains &ldquo;v3.0&rdquo;, and it is possible from this mixed cluster state to return to using a v3.0 etcd binary on all members.</p><p>Please <a href=../../op-guide/maintenance#snapshot-backup>backup the data directory</a> of all etcd members to make downgrading the cluster possible even after it has been completely upgraded.</p><h3 id=upgrade-procedure>Upgrade procedure</h3><p>This example shows how to upgrade a 3-member v3.0 etcd cluster running on a local machine.</p><h4 id=1-check-upgrade-requirements>1.
